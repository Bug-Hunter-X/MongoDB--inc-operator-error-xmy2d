# MongoDB $inc operator error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB's updateOne method. The issue occurs due to incorrect usage of the operator, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description
The `updateOne` method with the `$inc` operator fails to increment the specified field correctly if the field name is misspelled or the value is of an incorrect type.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.
2. Create a collection with a document containing a numerical field (e.g., 'counter').
3. Execute the provided JavaScript code using the MongoDB shell or a driver.
4. Observe the unexpected result.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully verifying the field name and the value type provided to the `$inc` operator. The corrected code ensures that the field name is accurately specified and the value is a valid number.
